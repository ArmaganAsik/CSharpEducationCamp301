*This project is a Windows Forms application that interacts with a database. The application performs database operations using the EducationCampEfTravelDbEntities class with Entity Framework methods and LINQ queries. The Database First approach is used to manage database relationships and data. This application provides a basic database management interface for projects like travel organizations. Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations can be performed on Guide and Location data, while the FrmStatistics form provides statistical data queries from the database. For example, it displays information such as total capacity, average price and the tour with the largest capacity (as shown in the screenshot).*
